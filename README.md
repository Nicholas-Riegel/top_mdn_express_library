# Library App

This is from the TOP/MDN documents on Node.js (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website). It is a "code-along" with some sections left for the learner to complete. 

The app includes complete CRUD operations for a library catalogue. Books, authors, genres, etc. may be created, read, updated and deleted.
